# Welcome to University of Exeter RSA Group üëã
The University has created centralised Research Software Engineering and Research Data Science teams, which together form the Research Software and Analytics (RSA) Group, to assist our research community with complex and bespoke research software needs and meet the ever-increasing demand for specialist skills to enable data-driven research.

## What are Research Software Engineers (RSEs)?

The primary role of an RSE is to develop and extend research software as an integral part of the research process. RSEs bring dual expertise in professional software development practices and domain speciÔ¨Åc knowledge, which enables them to produce reliable, eÔ¨Écient and maintainable software for research. Professional software engineering aids impact through the continued use of software tools after the research project has ended.

The use of research software has spread from traditional applications, such as numerical methods and simulation in maths, physics and chemistry, to being essential for data analysis or controlling experiments across disciplines.

RSEs work with researchers from all disciplines to gain an understanding of the problems they face, and then develop and extend software to provide the answers.

## What are Research Data Scientists (RDSs)?

The primary role of an RDS is to design and apply data science approaches to extract knowledge and insight from research data. They bring professional-level skills in data analysis combined with expertise in cutting-edge data science and AI, enabling them to produce reliable, eÔ¨Écient and reproducible analyses and models for research.

RDSs collaborate with academics across faculties to solve problems in all areas of research. They work closely with RSEs, providing a seamless set of services to design, develop and implement novel computational and AI tools to enhance the quality of data-driven research and increase impact.

## How can I engage with the RSA Group?

We are working to build a network of RSEs, RDSs and aligned research computing roles across the institution and would love to hear from staff performing similar roles at Exeter. If you're interested in meeting like-minded individuals, you can sign up to the Research Coding Community by completing [this online form](https://forms.office.com/e/2Kx1U6yYEr).

We are also happy to offer free advice on your software and analysis challenges. Please get in touch via [email](mailto:OVR-RSAGroup@list.exeter.ac.uk) (exeter.ac.uk email addresses only). If you are putting together a grant proposal, or are engaged in a research project, that you would like to work with us on, please complete and submit a [project collaboration request](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=d10qkZj77k6vMhM02PBKU7pzq71yeptIqEuQ7a4_BUtUNE1XQUdSTkE3WUhFRzZMN0RCVkkwSTVNQyQlQCN0PWcu).

For those interested in developing their skills, we underpin the *Coding for Reproducible Research (CfRR)* workshops. You can find more information about the initiative on the [CfRR homepage](https://coding-for-reproducible-research.github.io/CfRR_Courses/home_page.html).

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
